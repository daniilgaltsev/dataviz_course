    "text": "For this project I wanted to try to present the information about data jobs in a way that it would be easier to make judgements on the potential salary based on your and companyâ€™s location, if itâ€™s remote and your seniority. For this Iâ€™ve made a series of visualizations which were later evaluated by getting feedback from people working in data related jobs. Based on that feedback Iâ€™ve made some changes to the visualization and present them below.\n\n\nThe data for this project comes from a dataset of salaries for data related jobs. The raw data comes from ai-jobs.net and the dataset can be found on Kaggle. The data consists of 607 positions over 3 years (2020 - 2022). In addition to the salary and the year each position also has basic information about the company and the type of job.\n\n\n\nBased on the information provided in the dataset and preliminary exploration I wanted to make visualizations which would allow both to show the findings that I found interesting and to think about the data without directly working with it. This line of thought allowed me to select 5 areas which had an important effect on the salary and which I wanted to showcase:\n\nCompany Location\nWorking for a Foreign Company\nCompany Size and Experience\nRemote Work\nYearly Changes\n\n\n\n\nThe 5 areas listed above were the key considerations in choosing what kind of data relationships to visualize and how to do that. While these areas are still quite broad, they already provide enough of a base to start building visualization that allow to get some insight into them. However, due to the open-endedness itâ€™s still important to show a little bit more information in order to allow people to find their own insights.\nBased on that Iâ€™ve tried to balance simplicity and expressivity of visualizations. One of the main ways of achieving that was showing distributions of averages. While these visualizations are a bit harder to interpret, I thought that the shortcoming was justified because of the technological literacy of the target audience and the expressivity of visualizations. I believe that the feedback received during the evaluation confirms this.\n\n\n\nIn order to evaluate the visualizations, Iâ€™ve decided to show them to three people who have worked in data related jobs and listen to their feedback. The evaluation was structred in the following way:\n\nFirst, I told the general topic of the visualizations\nSecondly, they looked through each visualization while telling their thoughts on them\nAfter that I explained what each visualization was aimed to show and we had a final discussion about them\n\n\n\nBased on the received feedback Iâ€™ve condensed them into brief reviews of each visualization:\n\nCompany Location: generally good and clear, but would like more data points for some countries\nWorking for a Foreign Company:\n\nsalary distributions: not clear whatâ€™s trying to show/compare, the tail is difficult to see\naverage salary: not readable at all\n\nCompany Size and Experience: the visualization is ok, but itâ€™s not clear that itâ€™s clickable/selectable\nRemote Work: everythingâ€™s good\nYearly Changes: everythingâ€™s good\n\nFrom this list itâ€™s pretty straightforward to improve the visualizations by making them more clear."

The use of more complex visualizations works, but requires careful considerations in order to not make them incomprehensible. When thatâ€™s done right, the visualization work particularly well when the target audience is more technical.\nThe visualizations themselves still have room for improvement, especially, in the aesthetic front. All in all, I believe that these visualization already work quite effectively and the audience is able to analyse the data and make interesting conclusions without directly interacting with it."
